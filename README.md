### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We are in week 2 of of Turing's Front-End software development program. We were given the HTML and CSS for this project. We wrote the JavaScript, and it took approximately 18 hours to complete. The project specs can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/hang-in-there-v2.html).

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
This project was completed by [Sarah Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-moore-a35196127/) and [Carol Bradsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carol-bradsen/ "Carol Bradsen").


### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Learning goals were to write clean, DRY JavaScript, to explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to write code collaboratively. We worked with VSCode and github.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
**Wins:**
1. One of the greatest wins from from this project was how well we collaboratively coded, problem solved, and communicated!
1. We gained a deeper understanding of how CSS, HTML, and JavaScript work together.
1. Our Git Workflow went smoothly.

**Challenges:**

The project required us to self-teach some new concepts and incorporate classroom lessons in a collaborative virtual environment. We met this challege through online research, reading documentation, reaching out to our personal networks, and communication.
